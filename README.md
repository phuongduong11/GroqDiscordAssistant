!groq "Write a short poem about technology" model:mixtral-8x7b-32768
```
#### Complex Tasks
The bot can handle more complex tasks as well:
```

*Example: @‡∏ï‡∏∑‡πà‡∏ô‡∏°‡∏≤‡πÇ‡∏Ñ‡πâ‡∏îpython ‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏ô‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏Ñ‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏≠‡∏∞‡πÑ‡∏£?*

### Commands
- `!groq <prompt>` - Ask a text question
- `!groq <prompt> model:<model>` - Use a specific text model
- `!vision <prompt>` - Ask about your most recently uploaded image
- `!vision <prompt> model:<model>` - Use a specific vision model
- `!weather <location(s)>` - Get weather for one or more locations
- `!models` - List available models

## Weather Feature Details
The bot uses PydanticAI with Groq LLM to create a powerful weather agent that:

1. **Processes natural language** - Ask about weather in any way you want
2. **Supports multiple locations** - Check weather in several places at once
3. **Provides accurate data** - Uses Tomorrow.io API for real-time weather information
4. **Shows detailed information** - Temperature, conditions, humidity, and wind speed

### How the Weather Agent Works
1. The agent extracts location names from your query
2. It gets the coordinates using the Geocode Maps API
3. It fetches weather data from Tomorrow.io
4. The Groq LLM formats this data into a natural language response

### Weather Command Examples
```
!weather Bangkok
!weather Tokyo, Paris, New York
@YourBot What's the weather like in London today?
@YourBot Is it raining in Seattle?
```

## Vision Examples
### Analyzing Images
The bot can now analyze images and answer questions about them:
- Describe scenes and objects
- Identify text in images
- Answer questions about image content

### Using the Vision Command
If you've already shared an image, you can use the dedicated command:
```
!vision What can you tell me about this image?
```
This will analyze your most recently uploaded image.
